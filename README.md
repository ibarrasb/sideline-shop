## Description

Sideline shop is a e-commerce inspired web application that is based on sports. The application has several features that were implemented such as Authentication using JWT, Paypal checkout, a cart component, and ability to view previous purchases. Along with JWT, there is also an admin feature, which allows the user to create, read, update, and delete posts, also with the ability to view every purchase every made on the web app.

## ADMIN LOGIN
